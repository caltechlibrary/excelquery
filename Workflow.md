# Ideas about workflow

+ Enter titles and partial titles to query EPrints
+ use *xlquery* to return a list of links per query term
+ work that spreadsheet down until you have very few links per row
+ For each row with a sink link produce a BibTeX entry 
+ Export the BibTeX entries into a spreadsheet (fields become columns)
